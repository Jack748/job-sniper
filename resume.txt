Summary
Graduated M.Sc. Computer Science with AI specialization, focusing on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and optimization algorithms. Just finished working on my thesis on large-scale power grid synthesis using Ant-Colony Optimization.
1.5 years of experience as a Data Engineer, designing scalable ETL pipelines and migrating data to cloud platforms
(GCP, Azure) for major international clients.
Seeking Data Scientist / ML Engineer / AI Engineer roles. Passionate about ML, automation, and data-driven problem
solving. Target-focused, innovation-driven, and highly curious. Strong communicator who values clarity and alignment
in teamwork. In my free time I enjoy doing physical activity, including playing all kinds of sport.
